This code uses the Google Search API to search the web for websites that list free proxies, and then makes requests to those websites to scrape the proxies. It stores the proxies in a list and saves the list to a file.

Keep in mind that using a search engine API requires an API key and may have usage limits and costs associated with it. 
Additionally, the quality and reliability of the proxies you scrape may vary, and using a proxy comes with its own set of risks. 
Web scraping is also subject to the terms of service and policies of the websites



To allow the script to search for new proxy websites that can be scraped, you can use a search engine API to search the web for websites that list proxies. There are several search engine APIs available, such as the Google Search API and the Bing Search API, that allow you to make requests to their search engines and receive results in the form of structured data.


Change your Google api key and edit the settings you want.

To install do : pip install requirements.txt
